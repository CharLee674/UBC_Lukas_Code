Ke26XXA.py and hp816x_instr are wrappers for drivers from https://www.tek.com/source-measure-units/2635a-software/ivi-com-driver-series-2600a-2600b-system-sourcemeters-ke26xxa-iv
and https://www.keysight.com/main/software.jspx?cc=CA&lc=fre&nid=-11143.0.00&id=112417. The wrappers are placed in the lightlab/equipment/lab_instruments.

Colin_Lightlab_functions stores functions for a variety of sweeps such as photo current or wavelength-optical power. The sweep functions are made from simple functions from lightlab and the wrappers allowing for easy translation to other hardware.
